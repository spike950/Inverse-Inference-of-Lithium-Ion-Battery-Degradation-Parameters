# Inverse Inference of Lithium-Ion Battery Degradation Parameters via Physical Modeling and Data-Driven Machine Learning

This repository provides the implementation and supporting scripts for *Inverse Inference of Lithium-Ion Battery Degradation Parameters via Physical Modeling and Data-Driven Machine Learning*. 
Our research is addressed by segmenting battery degradation into a few stages. This work develops a physically informed inverse inference framework for lithium-ion battery degradation modeling. By leveraging the characteristic two-stage degradation behavior, it links observable features in experimental capacity-fade curves to internal degradation parameters through PyBaMM simulations and lightweight machine learning models, enabling efficient and interpretable parameter inference from aging data.

## Installation

You can install by following these steps:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:imnotstudy/Inverse-Inference-of-Lithium-Ion-Battery-Degradation-Parameters.git
```


## Usage

### Benchmark Reproduction

The benchmark entrypoint is:

```bash
python Scripts/run_benchmark.py --config configs/benchmark.yaml
```

The default config expects a prediction table at `data/benchmark/xgb_cap_50_sample.csv`. Replace that file path in `configs/benchmark.yaml` with your own benchmark input table when you are ready to run the full workflow.

The benchmark input CSV must contain these columns:

- `id`
- `sei`
- `plating`
- `crate`
- `b1`
- `b2`
- `pred_scale`

Running the benchmark writes outputs under `results/benchmark/`:

- `checkpoints/` for serialized intermediate `pybamm` solutions
- `summaries/` for per-case summary CSV files
- `logs/` for execution logs

## Data Availability

The PyBaMM-generated dataset used for this study can be found in the `PybaMM-dataset/` folder.
